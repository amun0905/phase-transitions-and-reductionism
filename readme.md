This repository contains Amun Govil Lie’s undergraduate summative essay for for the module Philosophy of Physics I: Space and Time (5AANB053) at King's College London. Mark received: 79.

The essay examines the problem of reducing thermodynamics (TD) to statistical mechanics (SM) — specifically the issue of phase transitions (PT).  

It argues that current SM models, which require infinite systems to reproduce thermodynamic singularities, are inconsistent with the finite systems of real-world physics.  

Drawing on work by Liu (1999), Callender (2001), and Mainwood (2006), the essay concludes that no general reduction is yet possible without deeper theoretical advances in SM.
