## 📄 Summary

The essay examines the **problem of reducing thermodynamics (TD) to statistical mechanics (SM)** — specifically the issue of **phase transitions (PT)**.  
It argues that current SM models, which require infinite systems to reproduce thermodynamic singularities, are inconsistent with the finite systems of real-world physics.  
Drawing on work by **Liu (1999)**, **Callender (2001)**, and **Mainwood (2006)**, the essay concludes that no general reduction is yet possible without deeper theoretical advances in SM.
